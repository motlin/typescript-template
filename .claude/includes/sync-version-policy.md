Always pin specific versions for every tool — never `latest`. Unpinned versions cause
unreproducible builds.

Every selected version must have been published for at least 24 hours. For pnpm-managed
packages, keep `minimumReleaseAge: 1440`, `minimumReleaseAgeStrict: true`, and
`minimumReleaseAgeIgnoreMissingTime: false` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. For tools managed
by mise, check the upstream release timestamp. When the newest release is too young,
check the immediately preceding release and repeat until one clears the 24-hour window.

Check for newer versions with mise, the single source of truth for tool versions:

```bash
mise ls-remote <tool> | tail -1
```

Compare against `.mise/config.toml` in this template. If the template is behind, update
it to the newest age-compliant release first, then propagate to projects.
