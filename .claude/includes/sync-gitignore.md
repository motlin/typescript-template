Two files decide what git ignores: `.gitignore`, which is tracked and shared with every
clone, and `.git/info/exclude`, which is per-clone and invisible to everyone else. They
drift in opposite directions, so scan both.

Both scans below rest on the same query — which ignore rule actually matched a file that
exists in the working tree right now:

```bash
git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard -z \
    | xargs -0 -r -n 500 git check-ignore -v \
    | awk -F'\t' '{print $1}' | sort -u
```

Each output line is `<source file>:<line number>:<pattern>`.

A third source can appear: the user's global ignore file (`~/.config/git/ignore` or
`core.excludesFile`). It is per-user rather than per-clone, so it hides paths from this
user in _every_ repo. Judge its entries the same way as `.git/info/exclude` ones — a path
that every clone of _this_ project will produce belongs in the project's `.gitignore` —
but never edit the global file as part of a project sync. Report it and let the user
decide.

## Promote per-clone excludes that every peer needs

Entries in `.git/info/exclude` protect one working copy. A teammate, a fresh clone, or a
new worktree gets none of them, so anything there that a build or tool recreates for
everyone shows up as untracked noise for the whole team.

List the active entries, then check which ones matched above:

```bash
grep -vnE '^\s*(#|$)' .git/info/exclude
```

An entry belongs in `.gitignore` instead when the path it hides is reproducible for any
clone: build output, tool or dependency caches, generated directories, agent scratch
directories. Generate a task to move it.

Keep it in `.git/info/exclude` only when it is genuinely local — a personal scratch file,
a machine-specific path, an editor's private state that peers would not create.

Also drop any exclude entry that a `.gitignore` pattern already covers. Duplicated intent
rots: the two copies diverge and the local one silently wins.

## Question .gitignore entries that match nothing

Every non-comment `.gitignore` line missing from the query output matched nothing in the
working tree.

Matching nothing is weak evidence on its own — plenty of correct patterns exist precisely
so a file never appears. Never propose removing:

- Patterns inside a vendored gitignore.io block (between its generated header and footer
  comments). That block is upstream-managed and mostly prophylactic by design; editing it
  guarantees a conflict the next time it is regenerated.
- Secret and credential patterns (`.env`, `*.pem`, `*credentials*`), which are load-bearing
  exactly when nothing matches them.
- OS and editor cruft (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.swp`).
- Patterns guarding files a build produces only on failure or under a flag: crash dumps,
  `hs_err_pid*`, coverage and profiling output.
- Negation patterns (`!…`) and any pattern a negation depends on — removing the broad
  pattern changes what the negation re-includes.

Propose removal only for a hand-added, project-specific entry naming a concrete path the
project no longer has: a dropped tool's cache directory, a renamed build directory, a
module that was deleted. Confirm the path is gone for good rather than merely absent from
a clean tree:

```bash
git log --oneline -1 -- '<path>'
```

## Never edit either file automatically

Same rule as stale configs. List every finding in the sync report and generate a task
naming the file, the line number, the pattern, and why it looks dead or misplaced. The
user confirms before anything is removed or moved.
